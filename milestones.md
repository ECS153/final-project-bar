### What I did last week
1. Discussed ideas about feasible projects to make.
2. I have been doing some research to understand the project and divide it into tasks to be assigned among our group members.

### What I plan to do this week
1. Implement user sign up functionality (probably just a nickname - no account attached).
2. User to user messaging functionality.
